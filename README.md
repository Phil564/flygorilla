# Flying Gorilla

This repo contains a kind of WIP decompilation of Flying Gorilla 2.14. Most of the game works, although this is not a perfect decompilation.

This is not the direct output of a Unity game decompiler. I had to fix a few issues, and had to replace a DLL in order to make playtesting work. 

The decompiler used was DevX, with a few code snippets coming from AssetRipper's output.

This is NOT a binary accurate decompilation, meaning that recompiling the game won't make a perfect APK.

Flying Gorilla 2.14 is a very old version of Flying Gorilla, one potentially published before the trailer on YouTube. The only reason why this version was chosen to be decompiled is because it's the only version that was compiled in Mono.

## Compiling

1. Install Unity 2018.2.1f1 from [here](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive#download-archive-2018).
2. Either download the repo from [here](https://github.com/Phil564/flygorilla/archive/main.zip), OR git clone the repository.
3. Open the repo in Unity 2018.2.1f1, and compile the game like you would do with any other game. You may need to specify a few things to the Editor in the Player Settings tho.
